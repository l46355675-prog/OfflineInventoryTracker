A simple, lightweight inventory management tool written in Java.
Designed for small shops, students, and beginners who want to track items and quantities offline, using a text file as storage.
✦ Add, remove, and update items
✦ Automatic low-stock warnings
✦ Data saved locally (no internet, no database)
✦ Runs in Termux or any Java environment
Built entirely on a phone as a proof that real software doesn’t require expensive tools.
